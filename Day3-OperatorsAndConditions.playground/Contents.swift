//Switch statement
//Swift will only run the code inside each case. If you want execution to continue on to the next case, use the fallthrough keyword like this:

//Range Operators
//For example, the range 1..<5 contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, whereas the range 1...5 contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
