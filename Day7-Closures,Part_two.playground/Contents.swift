//Shorthand parameter names
travell { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
//However, Swift knows the parameter to that closure must be a string, so we can remove it:
travell { place -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
//It also knows the closure must return a string, so we can remove that:
travell { place  in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
//As the closure only has one line of code that must be the one that returns the value, so Swift lets us remove the return keyword too:
travell { place  in
     "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
//Swift has a shorthand syntax that lets you go even shorter. Rather than writing place in we can let Swift provide automatic names for the closureâ€™s parameters. These are named with a dollar sign, then a number counting from 0.
travell {
     "I'm going to \($0) in my car"
}
